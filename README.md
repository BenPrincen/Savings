- Calculates how much money is left for spending that month
- Reminds the user how much money is left
- Formats the file so it can be viewed as a spreadsheet

    - Users can enter any money they spent into the mobile app
    - Mobile app will update a file in a format that can be viewed through a spreedsheet
    - Uses google drive to update the file on both devices to the most recent copy
    - Allows viewing the spreedsheet on both devices
